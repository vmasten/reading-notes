# Reading Notes

## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development
I've taken 301 before, but I'm super excited to learn some React and remember how JavaScript works (_and doesn't_).

Some things I'm hoping to get out of 301:
- Some solid React knowledge
- Improved JS skills in general
- ~~sleep :zzz:~~

***This is the end of my description.***
Wow, that was aggressive. Remind me **not** to do that again.
